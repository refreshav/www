The Refresh Annapolis Valley Labs is a playground where adventurous builders come to create.  Labs initiatives are community driven digital technology projects that tend to be entrepreneurial in nature.  In the lab, Refreshers work on building and applying their skills all while pursuing the objectives of their projects.

Refresh Annapolis Valley Labs is hosted at the Acadia Entrepreneurship Centre Rural Innovation Centre.  We meet on Saturdays from 12:30 to 3:30 starting January 26.  Bring your laptop.  Pizza will be served.

            <h4>Hikingo</h4>
            Hikingo is a map-based story game based in Nova Scotia that creates captivating tours for families and students. We provide tours of historic landmarks in your community for different age and skill levels. We call our tours “expeditions.” When you go on an expedition you can learn new facts about your community and take pictures to share with friends. After finishing an expedition you can rate your experience and pass on hints for future adventurers.

              <h4>Big Picture</h4>
              We are creating an app for youth to gain work experience through volunteering. There are many people who want to volunteer, but they can’t find the right opportunity nowadays. Our app will provide people with many volunteer resources which allows them to choose the type of volunteering jobs that are convenient and interesting for them. After volunteering, the volunteers can get ratings from their organizers based on their work, and vise versa, they can also rate the event/organization. Our app will keep track of people’s volunteering hours and experiences. This record can be automatically be updated to the volunteer’s LinkedIn account or their resume/CV for future use. If you are interested in this idea, come and join us!
